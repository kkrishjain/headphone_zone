  {%- when 'Storage' -%}
    <h6 class="h6">Storage</h6>
    <br>
    <p>Storage is important. Even in this era of streaming music, you‚Äôd want to make sure you have enough space to store
      your amazing collection of music on your player. Imagine a long flight, it‚Äôs your offline files you‚Äôre going to be
      listening to.
    </p><br>

    <p>Keeping your entire collection of Hi-Resolution music in one place is the most convenient way of carrying your
      music library. However, Hi-Resolution files are heavy. Most songs in a FLAC format can be about 100mb per track.
      So more space is always better.
    </p><br>

    <p>Most players support both internal storage and expandable storage via an external memory card. Make sure you check
      both - the internal memory on players, and consider the maximum supported size of the expandable storage. It‚Äôs
      best to keep your library of offline files in expandable storage and use the internal storage for saving files
      from streaming apps.
    </p><br>

    <p>At the time of writing this article, MicroSD cards for 256 GB were easily available and affordable for less than
      Rs. 2000. Higher capacity cards are also available, but that seems to be the sweet spot.
